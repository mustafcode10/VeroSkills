Callbacks 

a function calling another function - a function passed in as an argument
pass as argument do not include the parenthesis 
callbacks are a valuable part of asynchronous - its the callback that processes the data and that we wait for to return once the data is received.
avoid multiple callbacks which can make code difficult to read - also should avoid nesting within each other or you can caught up within each other as they wait for the responses

Promises
organize the sequence of code, produces a result that can be used within the next step
default callbacks parameters of resolve and reject
resolve() promise is successful and returns whatever is within the parameter
reject() is a failed promise - catch() is executed when the reject is triggered.

Fetch Method
fetch is used to request a resource which is external to the current file, it returns a promise that then resolves to a response object.

â€œ
Based on your call with the tutor, here are the studying recommendations:

1. Understand developer tools and how to access them.
2. Familiarize yourself with callback functions and their use in asynchronous programming.
3. Learn about promises and their three stages: fulfilled, rejected, and pending. Understand how to use promises in code.
4. Practice creating sequential execution of tasks using set timeout and promises.
5. Explore the concept of wrapper classes and how they can be used to sequentially call functions.
6. Understand the use of anonymous functions and their role in callback functions.
7. Study the concept of recursion and how it can be used in sequential function execution.
8. Learn about the differences between using promises and callback functions for sequential execution.
9. Explore the concepts of web APIs and AJAX requests.

Make sure to review the code examples provided by the tutor and practice implementing sequential execution of tasks using different approaches.
