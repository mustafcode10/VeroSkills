Certainly! Here are some exercises that build upon similar concepts, involving class hierarchies, inheritance, and prototype manipulation in JavaScript:

Exercise 1: Multimedia Library System
Create a class hierarchy for a multimedia library system. This system should handle different types of media items such as books, DVDs, and CDs.

Requirements:
Base Class MediaItem:

Add a private field #id and a constructor that initializes the id.
Provide a getter method for id.
Subclass Book:

Extend MediaItem.
Add additional properties title and author, and initialize them using the constructor.
Make the title property non-writable and non-enumerable.
Subclass DVD:

Extend MediaItem.
Add additional properties title and director, and initialize them using the constructor.
Make the title property non-writable and non-enumerable.
Subclass CD:

Extend MediaItem.
Add additional properties title and artist, and initialize them using the constructor.
Make the title property non-writable and non-enumerable.
Create Prototypes:

Create a prototype object mediaItemPrototype from the MediaItem prototype using Object.create.
Add a method getDetails() to the prototype that returns a string with the item's id and title.
Create Derived Classes:

Create classes LibraryBook, LibraryDVD, and LibraryCD that extend Book, DVD, and CD respectively using Object.assign.
Include the getDetails() method from mediaItemPrototype.
Instance Creation and Demonstration:

Create instances of LibraryBook, LibraryDVD, and LibraryCD.
Show that you can access the id, title, and respective properties.
Demonstrate that the title property is non-writable.
Use the getDetails() method to display item details.
Use instanceof to confirm the instance's type.
Exercise 2: Vehicle Hierarchy System
Create a class hierarchy for a vehicle system that handles different types of vehicles such as cars, trucks, and motorcycles.

Requirements:
Base Class Vehicle:

Add a private field #vin and a constructor that initializes the vin (Vehicle Identification Number).
Provide a getter method for vin.
Subclass Car:

Extend Vehicle.
Add additional properties make and model, and initialize them using the constructor.
Make the make property non-writable and non-enumerable.
Subclass Truck:

Extend Vehicle.
Add additional properties make and payloadCapacity, and initialize them using the constructor.
Make the make property non-writable and non-enumerable.
Subclass Motorcycle:

Extend Vehicle.
Add additional properties make and type, and initialize them using the constructor.
Make the make property non-writable and non-enumerable.
Create Prototypes:

Create a prototype object vehiclePrototype from the Vehicle prototype using Object.create.
Add a method getDetails() to the prototype that returns a string with the vehicle's vin and make.
Create Derived Classes:

Create classes Car, Truck, and Motorcycle that extend their respective base classes using Object.assign.
Include the getDetails() method from vehiclePrototype.
Instance Creation and Demonstration:

Create instances of Car, Truck, and Motorcycle.
Show that you can access the vin, make, and respective properties.
Demonstrate that the make property is non-writable.
Use the getDetails() method to display vehicle details.
Use instanceof to confirm the instance's type.
Exercise 3: Electronic Devices Hierarchy
Create a class hierarchy for an electronic devices system that handles different types of devices such as laptops, smartphones, and tablets.

Requirements:
Base Class Device:

Add a private field #serialNumber and a constructor that initializes the serial number.
Provide a getter method for serialNumber.
Subclass Laptop:

Extend Device.
Add additional properties brand and model, and initialize them using the constructor.
Make the brand property non-writable and non-enumerable.
Subclass Smartphone:

Extend Device.
Add additional properties brand and carrier, and initialize them using the constructor.
Make the brand property non-writable and non-enumerable.
Subclass Tablet:

Extend Device.
Add additional properties brand and screenSize, and initialize them using the constructor.
Make the brand property non-writable and non-enumerable.
Create Prototypes:

Create a prototype object devicePrototype from the Device prototype using Object.create.
Add a method getDetails() to the prototype that returns a string with the device's serial number and brand.
Create Derived Classes:

Create classes Laptop, Smartphone, and Tablet that extend their respective base classes using Object.assign.
Include the getDetails() method from devicePrototype.
Instance Creation and Demonstration:

Create instances of Laptop, Smartphone, and Tablet.
Show that you can access the serial number, brand, and respective properties.
Demonstrate that the brand property is non-writable.
Use the getDetails() method to display device details.
Use instanceof to confirm the instance's type.
These exercises will help reinforce the concepts of class inheritance, prototype manipulation, and property configuration in JavaScript.
